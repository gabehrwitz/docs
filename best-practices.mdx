## Data Organization

### Use Meaningful Names

Give your projects and datasets clear, descriptive names that your team will understand.

**Good examples:**
- "Q1 2024 Marketing Leads"
- "Customer Churn Analysis"
- "Product Inventory - US Warehouse"

**Avoid:**
- "Data1"
- "Test"
- "Final_v2_FINAL"

### Structure Your Projects

Group related datasets into projects by:
- **Team or department** - Marketing, Sales, Product
- **Initiative** - Product launch, Annual review
- **Data source** - CRM exports, Survey responses

<Tip>
Create a naming convention and document it. Consistency makes it easier for teammates to find what they need.
</Tip>

## Data Quality

### Clean Data on Import

Address data quality issues early:

1. **Remove duplicates** - Deduplicate immediately after import using primary keys
2. **Standardize formats** - Use operations to normalize dates, phone numbers, and addresses
3. **Handle nulls** - Decide how to treat missing values before analysis

### Set Primary Keys

Always designate primary keys for datasets that will be updated:

- Enables reliable deduplication
- Supports upsert operations
- Maintains record identity across updates

<Warning>
Without a primary key, appending data may create duplicates.
</Warning>

### Validate Your Data

Before sharing or exporting:

1. Check row counts match expectations
2. Verify column types are correct
3. Review a sample of transformed data
4. Test filters return expected results

## Operations Pipeline

### Order Matters

Apply operations in a logical sequence:

```
1. Filter (remove irrelevant rows first)
2. Deduplicate (on filtered data)
3. Transform (clean and standardize)
4. Sort (organize for output)
```

<Info>
Filtering before deduplication ensures you keep the right records when duplicates exist.
</Info>

### Keep Pipelines Simple

- Each operation should do one thing well
- Avoid overly complex filter conditions
- Break large transformations into steps
- Name operations descriptively

### Document Your Work

Add comments explaining:
- Why an operation was applied
- Business logic behind filters
- Data source and freshness
- Known limitations or caveats

## Collaboration

### Use Appropriate Access Levels

| When to use | Access level |
|-------------|--------------|
| Working draft | Keep private |
| Team review | Share with editors |
| Stakeholder review | Share as view-only |
| External sharing | Use share links carefully |

### Communicate Changes

When modifying shared datasets:
- Notify teammates before major changes
- Document what changed and why
- Use comments for context

### Review Before Sharing Externally

Before creating public links:
- Verify no sensitive data is exposed
- Check that filters are applied correctly
- Confirm the view shows what you intend

## Performance

### Optimize Large Datasets

For datasets with 100K+ rows:

- **Filter early** - Reduce row count before other operations
- **Limit columns** - Remove unnecessary columns
- **Use pagination** - Don't load everything at once
- **Export in batches** - For very large exports

### Import Efficiently

- Use CSV for large files (faster than Excel)
- Split very large files into chunks
- Remove unnecessary columns before import

## Version Control

### Leverage Version History

Rowbase automatically versions your data:

- **Before major changes** - Note the current version
- **After mistakes** - Rollback to a previous version
- **For audits** - Export data from specific points in time

### Create Checkpoints

Before significant transformations:
1. Export a backup
2. Note the version number
3. Document what you're about to change

<Tip>
Version history is your safety net. Don't be afraid to experiment knowing you can always go back.
</Tip>

## Security

### Protect Sensitive Data

- Never include passwords or API keys in datasets
- Be cautious with PII (names, emails, addresses)
- Use view-only sharing for sensitive reports
- Audit who has access to sensitive projects

### Manage Access Regularly

- Remove access when team members leave
- Review sharing settings quarterly
- Use project-level permissions over dataset-level when possible
