## API Keys

The Rowbase API uses API keys for authentication. Every request must include your API key in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl https://api.rowbase.com/v1/datasets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Creating API Keys

1. Log in to [app.rowbase.com](https://app.rowbase.com)
2. Go to **Settings → API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name
5. Copy the key immediately

<Warning>
Your API key is only shown once when created. Store it securely. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.
</Warning>

## Key Permissions

API keys inherit permissions from the user who created them. A key can:

- Access all projects and datasets the user can access
- Perform any action the user is authorized to perform
- Cannot change organization settings or billing

## Managing API Keys

### View Active Keys

See all active API keys in **Settings → API Keys**. Each key shows:

- Name
- Created date
- Last used date
- Partial key preview (last 4 characters)

### Revoke a Key

To revoke an API key:

1. Go to **Settings → API Keys**
2. Find the key to revoke
3. Click the **Revoke** button
4. Confirm the action

<Warning>
Revoking a key is immediate and irreversible. Any applications using that key will stop working.
</Warning>

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Never expose keys in client-side code" icon="eye-slash">
    API keys should only be used in server-side code. Never include them in JavaScript that runs in the browser, mobile apps, or public repositories.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables" icon="terminal">
    Store API keys in environment variables, not in your codebase.

    ```bash
    export ROWBASE_API_KEY="your_key_here"
    ```

    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.environ.get('ROWBASE_API_KEY')
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create separate keys for each environment" icon="layer-group">
    Use different API keys for development, staging, and production. This makes it easy to rotate keys without affecting all environments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly" icon="rotate">
    Periodically create new API keys and revoke old ones, especially if team members leave or if you suspect a key may have been compromised.
  </Accordion>

## Authentication Errors

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "authentication_error",
    "message": "Invalid API key"
  }
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Invalid API key
- Revoked API key
- Malformed header (missing "Bearer" prefix)

### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "authorization_error",
    "message": "You don't have access to this resource"
  }
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Trying to access a resource in a different organization
- Insufficient permissions for the action
