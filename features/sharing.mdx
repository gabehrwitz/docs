## Project Access

Projects can have their own access controls, separate from organization-level permissions.

### Project Roles

- **Project Admin** - Full control of the project
- **Editor** - Create, edit, and delete datasets within the project
- **Viewer** - Read-only access to project datasets

### Setting Project Access

1. Open the project
2. Go to **Settings → Access**
3. Add members or change roles
4. Changes take effect immediately

## Dataset Sharing

### Share Link

Create a shareable link to a dataset:

1. Open the dataset
2. Click **Share**
3. Choose access level:
   - **View only** - Recipients can see data but not edit
   - **Can comment** - Recipients can add comments
   - **Can edit** - Recipients can modify data
4. Copy and share the link

<Warning>
Anyone with the link can access the dataset at the specified permission level. Use with caution for sensitive data.
</Warning>

### Public Datasets

Make a dataset publicly accessible:

1. Open dataset **Settings**
2. Enable **Public Access**
3. Choose whether to allow:
   - Viewing
   - Downloading (CSV/Excel export)
   - API access

Public datasets are accessible without authentication but can be made undiscoverable (only accessible with direct link).
