## Overview

Datasets are the foundation of Rowbase. They store your structured data in a tabular format with automatic type detection, versioning, and schema validation.

## Creating Datasets

### From File Upload

The most common way to create a dataset is by uploading a file:

1. Navigate to your project
2. Click **Upload** or drag and drop a file
3. Supported formats: CSV, TSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
4. Rowbase automatically detects:
   - Column headers
   - Data types
   - Date formats
   - Number formats

<Tip>
For large files (100MB+), consider using the API for more control over the import process.
</Tip>

### From Paste

Quickly import data by copying from any spreadsheet:

1. Click **Paste** in your project
2. Copy cells from Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet application
3. Paste into the Rowbase input
4. Review the preview and confirm

### Via API

Create datasets programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.rowbase.com/v1/datasets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Customer List",
    "project_id": "proj_xxx",
    "columns": [
      {"name": "email", "type": "text"},
      {"name": "signup_date", "type": "date"},
      {"name": "plan", "type": "text"}
    ],
    "data": [
      {"email": "alice@example.com", "signup_date": "2024-01-15", "plan": "pro"},
      {"email": "bob@example.com", "signup_date": "2024-01-20", "plan": "free"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Schema & Data Types

Each dataset has a schema that defines its columns and their types.

### Supported Types

| Type | Description | Auto-Detection Examples |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|
| `text` | String values | "Hello", "user@email.com" |
| `number` | Integers and decimals | 42, 3.14, -100 |
| `boolean` | True/false | true, false, yes, no, 1, 0 |
| `date` | Dates and timestamps | 2024-01-15, 01/15/2024, Jan 15 2024 |
| `json` | Nested objects | {"key": "value"} |

### Type Coercion

Rowbase attempts to coerce values to match column types:

```
"123" in a number column → 123
"true" in a boolean column → true
"2024-01-15" in a date column → 2024-01-15T00:00:00Z
```

<Warning>
Values that can't be coerced are stored as `null`. Check the import preview for any conversion issues.
</Warning>

## Primary Keys

Designate one or more columns as the primary key to:

- Enable deduplication based on key columns
- Support upsert operations via API
- Track record identity across updates

```bash
# Set primary key via API
curl -X PATCH https://api.rowbase.com/v1/datasets/ds_xxx \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"primary_key": ["email"]}'
```

## Version History

Every change to a dataset is versioned:

- View the full history of changes
- Compare versions side-by-side
- Rollback to any previous version
- Export data from any point in time

<Info>
Versions are created automatically when you apply operations, import data, or make edits.
</Info>

## Column Operations

### Rename Columns

Click any column header to rename it. The new name is applied across all operations and formulas.

### Change Column Type

1. Click the column header
2. Select **Change Type**
3. Choose the new type
4. Review any coercion warnings
5. Confirm the change

### Hide/Show Columns

Hide columns to simplify your view without deleting them:

- Hidden columns are still available in formulas and API responses
- Toggle visibility from the column menu or view settings

### Reorder Columns

Drag column headers to reorder them, or use the column settings panel for bulk reordering.

## Filtering & Search

### Quick Filter

Click the filter icon on any column to:

- Filter by exact value
- Filter by condition (contains, starts with, etc.)
- Filter by multiple values

### Global Search

Use the search bar to find rows containing specific text across all columns.

### Advanced Filters

Create complex filter conditions with AND/OR logic:

```
(status = "active" AND created_at > "2024-01-01")
OR
(status = "pending" AND priority = "high")
```

## Exporting Data

Export your dataset in multiple formats:

<CardGroup cols="3">
  <Card title="CSV" icon="file-csv">
    Standard comma-separated values
  </Card>
  <Card title="Excel" icon="file-excel">
    .xlsx format with formatting
  </Card>
  <Card title="JSON" icon="brackets-curly">
    Array of objects
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Export options:
- **All data** - Export the complete dataset
- **Filtered data** - Export only rows matching current filters
- **Selected columns** - Choose specific columns to include
